ARM Assembly & C Project - Autonomous Environmental Monitoring System
Overview

This embedded systems project implements an autonomous environmental monitoring system using the STM32F401RE microcontroller. It is developed in C using ARM CMSIS libraries and integrates real-time sensor readings, interrupt-driven control, and peripheral interaction.

The system continuously monitors temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor and provides visual feedback through an onboard LED. A capacitive touch sensor allows the user to dynamically interact with the system, enabling or disabling output display in real-time.
Requirements

    Microcontroller: Nucleo STM32F401RE

    Peripherals: DHT11 sensor (temperature & humidity), capacitive touch sensor, onboard LED

    Tools: Keil uVision, PuTTY/Tera Term (for UART display)

    Languages: C (ARM CMSIS-based)

Functionality
1. DHT11 Sensor Reading

    Periodically triggered (every few seconds) using a hardware timer.

    Reads temperature and humidity values via GPIO-based communication protocol.

    Timing-critical implementation (similar to Adafruitâ€™s bit parsing logic).

2. UART Output

    Transmits formatted sensor data to a terminal (e.g., Tera Term) via UART.

    Example output:

    Temperature: 25Â°C  
    Humidity: 60%  
    --------------------

3. LED Control Logic

    Based on sensor data:

        If temperature > 30Â°C â†’ LED blinks fast.

        If humidity > 70% â†’ LED blinks slowly.

        Otherwise â†’ LED remains OFF.

4. Touch Sensor Interrupt

    Connected to an external interrupt line (EXTI).

    On touch:

        Toggles output display mode:

            Enabled â†’ UART shows live sensor readings.

            Disabled â†’ UART silenced (data collected silently).

        Status change and touch count printed via UART.

5. System Behavior Summary

    All components work autonomously after startup.

    Sensor reads and outputs are timer-based.

    Touch sensor gives user control over system verbosity.

    LED offers immediate physical feedback based on environmental conditions.
